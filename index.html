<h1>Sungjin Lee</h1>

<p>Grade distribution, tetris, clone coding tutorials</p>

<p>As having a dream of my own startup, I need to prepare for it. Connect people: Web, app. For job, prepare what you are afraid of, 
    so you are not afraid of it anymore. Show you can adapt new technology fast.

    Worked all day. Didn't code today but didn't want to stop records, either. Will make some after finishing my work now.

    quite confused about python's version control. Does mac have its own default version of python like ruby?
